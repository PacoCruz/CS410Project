0,B002IBFUNG,"[3, 3]","I may update later with a less glowing review, after having some time on these.But for now... I just installed these on a 2009 E92 M3 Coupe. The halogens right side went out, and so I bought a pair of these to replace, having read TONS of reviews that said the LED stuff just would not be bright enough in the daytime, because the new BMW's LED halo eyes had different light tunnelling technology, and my halo light tunnels were more suited for the halogen wavelengths or brightness pattern.So instead of stock halogen, being disappointed that I could not achieve modern BMW white brightness ala LED, I got the PIAA extreme yellow.Install was quick. Watched a couple youtube videos (best tip was make sure the lights are TURNED OFF before starting, no need to disconnect battery) on how to replace the lamps and I was done in 20 min from start to finish and I have big hands and those light compartments are SMALL!Upon powerup, the lights were a deep orange... very close in color to the parking lights. I was like huh... thought they would be more yellow, but fine, orange is quite cool too , my paint is jet black.After about 5 min, the color had turned to a bright yellow... so maybe the bulbs had to burn in a bit. The yellow is quite bright and deep in it's yellow-ness, and I was quite pleased at the contrast between that yellow and the bi-xenon headlight projectors. It looks really cool imho, a nice contrast. Much better than the halogen pale yellow.Tried to take a pic but the brightness is so high that it comes out as pure white in the picture... only our human eyes have that much dynamic range.Very highly recommended for the factory halogen angel eyes, preLED. I hope they last long as other reviews said these would burn out quick.I will post if that happens, meanwhile, these are quite pleasing to the eye, and much cheaper than H8 LED  lamps.Highly recommended.p.s. both driver and passenger bulbs do turn clockwise to remove, and counter clockwise to install. The driver side is easier on the M3 due to the fact that the bulb starts at 1100 and you turn to 0300 ... the passenger starts at 0100 and turns to like 0400... bit harder but totally doable. Just get your hands in there and be careful.I used a rubber glove to hold the new bulb so as not to get finger grease and ruin the glass.",5.0,"09 5, 2013",PIAA 18535 H8 Plasma Ion Yellow Bulb - Twin Pack,59.84,Piaa,2309,434,1.0,5.320276497695851,7.172854323767832,1.1946105790109216,1.0260362875098494,1.0

For those with codes that it read that had already been repaired... your mechanic should have cleared the codes in the computer after the repair but did not.  Now you can clear them yourself. :) It's possible the repair didn't work, either, but if the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp, aka check engine light etc) didn't come back on, you should be fine.-----------------------------This Autel scans my 1998 Subaru Legacy and read the P0440 code just the same as the Actron.  It cleared the code successfully and the MIL turned off.  This unit also scans my wife's 2010 Toyota RAV4, but it doesn't have any check engine light to confirm codes or any of that stuff.The included manual comes with generic DTC definitions, but the definitions are so short you need to search them on the web anyway to translate and determine the severity.  That's true with just about any scanner, especially those in this price range so I was expecting that.  The manual does not list manufacturer specific codes that the tool presumably reports, but you can get those on the web.  I've found that obd-codes dot com to be a good resource for _most_ DTC generic and manufacturer specific definitions.  It also includes other details for generic codes that are helpful.It is true that most auto parts stores will scan your car for free, but that's not always convenient.  Plus, if you have an intermittent problem that occassionally trips the MIL, you might dismiss any future instance of the MIL as the original issue, and potentially cause harm to your vehicle.  If you own a scanner, it's easy to regularly verify.I also own a more expensiveActron CP9180but I bought the Autel to leave in my car at all times.  Since MS300 so inexpensive I wouldn't be too upset if it gets baked in the summer heat.  This product feels like a toy (very light and it has a short short cord...maybe 18""), but it seems to work.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the feel of the product, but quite honestly I wasn't expecting anything more based on the price and the fact that these are made in china.My Actron has a lot of features that I'll never use (I'm just a consumer, not a mechanic), but it is a solid product that will presumably last much longer than the cheaply made MS300.

But it is only worth 4 stars because to withstand any rain accumulation the strap on the back of the jeep better be extremely tight with the cover tucked in as much as possible or the rain accumulation on the cover will cause it to cave in, dumping the water into the back of the jeep.  Also, when the rain accumulates on the cover on top of the jeep it causes it to sag, and now the trick is to remove the cover without all the rain water spilling into your front and back seats.  The picture for the jeep cover shows the cover over the hard or soft top of a jeep, making it look like water will just run off of it.  But the reason anyone has this cover is to put over their jeep when the top is off to protect it from rain.  Therefore, once again a good strategy is needed to remove the cover without rain water spilling into the jeep.",4.0,"11 30, 2012",Genuine Jeep Accessories 82210323 Black Vehicle Cover,127.68,Jeep,1065,213,1.0,5.0,3.5203179054436595,0.9556884632087372,2.1892432016921397,0.9876527786254883
155,B003N6H9W0,"[2, 2]","I was a little unsure about buying this set online, but they are in fact the correct mounts for my Accord. I have a 1999 3.0L V6 Accord EX sedan. Also, these were a great price and I could not find them cheaper anywhere else.If you're replacing one of the hydraulic mounts, or more than 2 others - it's a good idea to replace the entire set.I did not install these myself, rather when my transmission was replaced I had the mechanic put these in. He installed all but the rear hydraulic mount as it would have required a lot of extra work to remove.They seem to work just fine, and they match the factory equipment almost exactly. The mount that goes just above the serpentine belts does not have a small metal piece that my factory mount had, but it does not seem to matter. The metal piece served no function I could discern.I do have experience removing these mounts (the factory mounts anyway), and some of them are rather difficult. You absolutely will need an impact wrench, and probably a heavy one at that. We had to use 200+ lbs of air pressure and a 3/4"" impact wrench to remove the upper bolts on the front and back mounts. Removing the rear mount was nearly impossible for me, mainly because the top bolt is difficult to access. I was salvaging a transmission from a wrecked accord and we were able to move things around a bit more than one might on a car that you don't want to mess up.If possible, use an engine hoist to suspend the engine & transmission and simply lift both up a few inches in order to replace these.Your mileage may vary.I give the product 5 stars because it's exactly what I needed at a great price.",5.0,"07 16, 2011",M064 98-02 Honda Engine Motor Mount 5PCS Accord Odyssey 3.0L V6 Acura CL TL With Hydraulic 98 99 00 01 02,96.8,MotorKing,1633,315,1.0,5.184126984126984,5.206103944670201,1.1946105790109216,1.659764582736521,2.9802322387695312e-08

192,B006NZTZLQ,"[5, 7]","I bought the OBDLink a few years ago and didn't really use it that much because it couldn't read codes from all the modules in my car and it required a computer to connect with. For the most part, my old OBDLink just sat in a drawer collecting dust. I discovered the Torque Android app recently, and decided that I would try to add Bluetooth to my old OBDLink and keep it in my car. I contacted ScanTool.net to get Bluetooth added to my device, and while I was perusing their website I came across the OBDLink MX.The OBDLink MX solves many of the issues that I would have had a hard time dealing with after adding Bluetooth to my old OBDLink. Namely, the MX goes to sleep automatically after you turn the car off (I would have had to manually unplug the old OBDLink), it supports an additional CAN protocol that my vehicle uses, it's small and has no wires that need hiding like my old OBDLink, it supports faster data rates than the OBDLink, and the Bluetooth protocol is far more secure, so I don't have to worry about some dude pulling up next to me and fiddling with my ECU.ScanTool.net allowed me to trade in my old OBDLink for a significantly reduced price on the OBDLink MX. I made the swap and I couldn't be happier. I have the device connected 24/7 in my car and Torque Pro on my smartphone. I have a server running this guy's code (search Google for ""torque ip v6 me uk"") at home and Torque will send logs from my car directly to my home server. I can then pull up any of my trip logs at home and views things like boost pressure, G-forces, speed, and mpg at any instant during my trip plotted with GPS coordinates on Google Maps. The OBDLink MX's speed allows me to get extremely impressive temporal resolution logging on over 15 different PIDs.The OBDLink MX is a great piece of engineering, and ScanTool.net's service is excellent.

Then I tried this stuff and it works beautifully. It cleans and restores vinyl, rubber and plastics like nothing I've used to date. I'll use it on plastics and rubber, door seals, wiper blades, dash boards, it's my go-to interior cleaner. for everything besides carpet, metal, leather, glass and fabric. This stuff lasts too. I'd have to apply other products at least once a month. I can go 6 months with this stuff before I realize I should retreat just to make sure everything is well treated. It works that well, I only dust the dash every couple weeks as opposed to retreating just as often.it managed to restore many exterior ""faded"" plastics to their original color and shine and keep them there for longer than I expected. My dash looks the same as when the car was new. it managed to clean a spot where my elbow rests on the door below the window when driving that nothing else managed to get clean. my black rubberized control looked grey after 6 years, a quick wipe of this stuff and it's back to the original black. This stuff really works wonders on rubber, making it softer and more pliable than before treatment. Don't expect miracles; it won't repair hardened rubbers to the point of making them soft again, but it will slightly loosen firm rubber.Cons: it is a bit oily, so I wipe on and let sit for a few minutes then wipe off the remainder. This results in the shine or texture of the surface being restored to their original, non-glossy, non-greasy finish. with other products I have tried they have always left a residue even after wiping excess. it seems like no matter what, wiping rubber makes the cloth that you are wiping with come off black. not sure what is going on there, but things work well and this restores seals that are dirty and a little noisy to their original state. If using on wipers, you'll want to wipe off the residue a couple times and let air dry for a bit before putting the blades back on the glass.I hear that 303 Protectant is considered better, and it is more general use but I bought this before I knew about 303 and this one bottle has lasted me several years.",4.0,"01 15, 2013",Meguiar's M40 Mirror Glaze Vinyl &amp; Rubber Cleaner &amp; Conditioner - 16 oz.,9.97,Meguiar&#39;s,2375,447,1.0,5.313199105145414,7.387709407198666,0.9556884632087372,0.17094889349052808,1.0

That's because you hooked it up to a continuous circuit.  In my case, however, I installed it on a 2005 Dodge Sprinter 2500.  Used a fuse tap on the wrong circuit, so changed it to another.  Pulling the fuse tap spread the fuse socket apart, redering my vehicle inoperable.  Had to take the fuse block completely out of the steering column and apart to squeeze the socket back so the fuse would stay in.  Don't make the same the mistake I did!  After all that, got it working properly, but it would not connect.  I checked all connections again, and even plugged my OBD reader into the OBD port to make sure.  The next day, Tech Support simply suggested sending me a new OBD module.  Tried the replacement module, and still ""unable to connect"".  Tech Support again, this time, with Travis, who was alot more helpful.  He walked me through some diognostics, but still no-go.  He checked with his ""engineer"" and told me that this has a habit of working on only some of the Dodge Sprinters, but not all.  He called me back a short time later and suggested I removed the BD fuel module I had installed and try it again.  I did and still ""unable to connect"".  I called Travis back to advise.  I suggested the 2005 Dodge Sprinter 2500 be taken off the list, but was willing to test their product once they figured out the problem.Returns to Amazon are a snap, and I hope the refund is prompt, because this has been quite a hassle.  As far as not getting all the information I would want on the guage, I probably would not want it at all if I couldn't get temperature, pressure, and voltage readings on multiple components.

This causes the grip to rattle when the bike is idling and your hands are not on the bars.Its not a deal breaker by any means. but a little bit tighter of a tolerance would be advised.

It took about 20 minutes with great results.  Not as loud as I would have liked, but much better sound more likely to get attention when needed.  I was mystified that some of the reviewers apparently only installed one or the other of the horns.  They are meant to be installed as a pair (even if you only have one horn as original equipment).  If you do have only one horn its a simple matter to re-wire for two horns.  The package includes simple easy to follow wiring diagrams and a pair of ground wires (one for each horn).  In my case I had one power wire to one horn, so I joined two wires together at the male end (to plug into the power lead) and two separate female ends to plug into the horns.

325,B0009JKIRC,"[62, 67]","Back in the day, I had done some detailing work, and we all loved Zymol. The wax was rather costly, however. Then Meguiers came out with an outstanding cleaner wax in the mid 90's that made all of our lives easier. So, I stopped using the zymol hard-wax and moved to the new cleaner hybrids. It took Zymol a few years to bring to market, so I was glad to see that they understood the market and developed some thoroughly modern products. I have been using this Zymol Cleaner wax ever since it received top reviews from CR and a few car mags. As a side note, I was a biochemist for a while and always like to devise ""tests"" on the products I use! So, I chose to wax my car with Zymol, and my wife's car with Meguiers cleaner wax, as well as my truck with Mother's cleaner-wax. I can't say that there were huge differences in performance between the 3 brands over the 10 years that I have used these waxes. But, there are a few reasons why I chose to use the Zymol wax on my car and not the other 2. First, the Zymol applies very easily. It spreads well and is easily removed by buffer, or by hand. The scent is very pleasant too. I noted that the zymol must also have an oil in it that remains after the buffing. I noticed that my car (grey metallic) had a deeper, almost ""wet"" shine to it. This effect only lasts about 2 rain storms, but it is still very rewarding! As far as longevity, they were too close to call. I got more oxidation from the Mother's brand, but it was on a Honda and not a Porsche. The paint may be a large variable. As far as the ""cleaner"" effect, I would say that it seems to remove light swirls and hard water spots effectively. I still use a dedicated swirl-remover from meguiers before I wax anyway......So in conclusion, I would say that the Zymol wax is an easy to apply, 3 month lasting, nicely scented, reasonably priced, and wet-shiny product.

349,B00A9T28R0,"[6, 6]","I was considering purchasing one of the other well-known products in this category, OPT, when I ran across this. I had a feeling the other stuff was likely better, but it was 3-4x as much (purchase price, not in value breakdown) and a rinse-free wash wasn't really high up on my shopping list. It was just something I wanted to try out. When I came across this locally for about $6 I figured what the heck. The only thing that made me hesitate was that this includes synthetic polymer, similar to what you'd find in a spray wax/detailer, and I prefer to have single-purpose solutions, but I figured there's no significant drawback to a bit of added synthetic protectant.It says to use 4 ounces per 2 gallons of water. Just eyeballing it, I guessed a cap full is about half an ounce, so I put 5 caps (an extra cap full to be sure) into one gallon of water. One gallon, it turns out, was plenty to clean my late model Accord sedan, which isn't a small car. I proceeded to use a microfiber wash-mitt to wipe down the car with this stuff. It felt like I was washing with plain water, aside from the scent, but it cleaned the car and left a shine comparable to any post-wash shine. Nothing spectacular, but I'm concerned with the cleaning, not any added shine. I wash my car under a car-port, but my driveway is gravel/dirt. Usually when I wash conventionally, my car ends up surrounded by wet gravel and dirt, so I have to be extra careful. This stuff obviously made that less of an issue, which is nice. As stated, it likely leaves a small amount of synthetic protectant, which I'm not concerned with but it's an added bonus, maybe adding at least a little bit of protection behind when I don't feel like following up with a spray-wax/paste.Despite being marketed as a Wash and Wax rather than just a rinseless wash, Turtle Wax doesn't make much effort to specifically refer to any level of protection such as UV, while some other polymer-containing rinseless wash&waxes; do. Which brings me to..Relative to ONR: Turtle Wax RFWW is actually more expensive than the competition from Optimum, since it requires 400% more fluid per use. If I had to guess, I would say the formula is quite similar to Optimum's product, only more dilute. Maybe the other stuff is better, but as I see it, it either cleans the car or it doesn't, and this stuff does. Both claim to leave behind a polymer coating, and it's anyone's guess whether or not the polymers differ in quality between them. ONR does have a better reputation as a premium brand and it's fairly obvious Turtle Wax was inspired (to use a nice word) by Optimum in creating this product, but that doesn't necessarily mean one or the other is better. It's worth noting that Optimum actually has a two different rinseless washes, with one of them being a wash&wax;, and oddly it's the non-wax version that appears to be more similar to the Turtle Wax product. I'm going to try ONR and probably update this review accordingly.I think I'll still do old-fashioned suds cleaning now and then, but seeing as how this works just about as well and took 5-7 minutes (seriously, I did the entire car, including drying, in less than ten minutes), I think I'll be buying this again.I'm starting to like Turtle Wax as a brand. There's a manly urge to research and purchase high-end car care products, and I'm not immune to that, but Turtle Wax products (especially their newer stuff) seem to be a good value from a company that appears to take their car-care products seriously.

No issues at all with the generator.  My only issue is with Generac's packaging. Potential buyers should be aware that if buying online where fright shipping is required, there is at least a decent chance your generator will arrive damaged. The first Generac generator ordered was damaged beyond safe use due to poor packaging. This one was ordered though Home Depot online, not Amazon. As it turned out, even though it took 3 full weeks to see the generator, it was a bonus because I was simply able to drop it off at my local store for a refund. Home Depot was out of stock everywhere on this model, so ordered the second one from Amazon and got it in 4 days! Should have done that the first time... The Generac packaging is a thin tight fitting cardboard box. I read of Generac generators being delivered with dented control panels. This was true of my first unit.  The panel was severely dented in which also destroyed the electronics enclosure behind the panel, exposing the electronics to the weather. The fuel tank flange was bent at the two mounting points where it attaches to the control panel, a leak waiting to happen. The second generator, ordered from Amazon, faired better.  Only a slight push in on the panel that caused no other damage.  I pulled it out and all is well. These are not inexpensive items. If I didn't NEED the generator, I would have sent this one back too, but it is safe to use otherwise so I kept it. Generac should correct this with a better box. A simple strip of wood across the panel would correct this issue. These items are NOT packaged for safe shipment by Generac.  BTW, before returning the first generator, I did call Generac to see if the damage may be covered by warrantee.  They were in no way interested in helping with anything.  In fact, if not for the fact that I was sold on this particular model for the performance vs. cost, I would have NOT purchased a second generator from Generac.

It does produce quite a bit of power, but we seem unable to run both of our energy efficient freezers simulatneously (about 1.7 amps draw each freezer --200watts).  Also, it does not come with cables to attach it to the batteries, so expect to buy those too.  Lastly, and most importantly is the noise.  The inverter cooling fan starts up at even the smallest load, and it is loud.  As more load is applied the cooling fan ramps up louder and louder.  It is not so loud as to hurt your ears, but it is loud enough to be annoying and to heard throughout whatever room it is in, so I recommend you buy the remote start if you choose to buy this unit.  Locate it in a closet or shed so you don't have to listen to it.We have had other inverters that cost much less, but of course only 1200 Watts of power, that had NONE of the shortcomings of this one (our old 1200 Watt model simultaneously ran both freezers, T.V. VCR, DVD player, speakers, and lights; it came with a connector cable, and its fan was quiet and only came on during high loads).  The reason we purchased this one is because all the previous inverters, although quiet and efficient, eventually died, and we hoped that this one could handle the peak loads better.9 April 2009: Just a brief update.  At this point in time the inverter is useless, the cooling fans quit working so I am hesitant to use if for fear of a fire (that happened with another inverter several years ago).

Easy installation, but a 3/4"" deep well socket is required with an wrench socket extension.  Essentially one simply removes two existing screws from under the car, and combined with two screws supplied, fit it up with the four screws, torque it, and your done!  Borrow a torque wrench - very important - do not guess at the torque required.  I wrench for a living, and guessed temporarily until bringing it into the shop for torque-up.  Maybe it was working upside down while laying on the ground...but I guessed too soft.  The hitch fit very well, but the hitch rides pretty low to the ground (no lower than all that other stuff under there - this car rides low!).  My use is for cargo box, bike rack, and towing 18 ft sail boat.  ""Stowaway hitch tightener"" sold here is required to reduce wobble of cargo box and bike rack. Over all very satisfied with this hitch receiver.UPDATE: As compared to the Hidden Hitch receivers on my other two vehicles, this Curt receiver seems to hold accessories such as bike rack, cargo box, and ball mounts a little more loosely (a little more wobble, flopping and clunking).

455,B004VFJL14,"[3, 4]","Before purchasing the lt5000d I read all the previous reviews.  It was clear that the latest generation of this cutter did not have the problems of earlier models.  I have used it now for two weeks.  I cut 30 square holes in 1/8 mild steel.  Then I cut 40 feet of 3/32 inch steel using a piece of 1 1/4 inch angle iron for a guide.  The cut was straight and clean.  Then I cut the hinges off a 1966 military 2.5 ton truck where the metal varied from 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch.  The cutter sliced through the thickest metal with ease.  It took a few tries to learn to cut without burning through the tip.  The extra consumables were a smart purchase.  Now, after all of the above my cutting tips last much longer and I am satisfied with how long they last.  During the above cutting I tried the 220 volt which works the best.  Then I tried the 110 volt on a 30 amp circuit which worked well but I did have to move the cutter slower.  My son tried the 110 volt on a 15 amp circuit and there wasn't enough power to cut the 3/32 inch steel.  This is no reflection on the machine.  You have to give it the power it requires and then it will work just fine.  I had none of the problems mentioned in previous reviews of earlier models.

Determined to make sure I was doing everything right, I let the new battery charge overnight.  The next morning - the all too familiar *one weak revolution followed by clicks*!  I contacted the supplier again who apologized and promptly refunded my money.  The supplier never asked me to return either battery nor did he ask for any kind of proof...  Which tells me he was fully aware of the quality issues with these batteries.In my opinion, if you get two identical items (of anything) that fail right out of the box...  Likely, the quality of the entire product line is sadly lacking.  It's time to stop wasting time and money and try something different.From my experience, these are extremely poor quality batteries for Harley Davidson motorcycles.  They just don't have the cold cranking amps needed.  They MAY work OK for foreign bikes that may require less CCA.  But, if you have a Harley, I would strongly suggest spending the extra money for a quality, name brand battery from a local retailer.Update: 04/04/2013.  I let my Harley sit over the winter without buying a new battery for her.  While she was in storage, a friend of mine told me about top quality batteries from ""ThrottleX Batteries"" - Which Amazon does sell.  They are ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT manufacturer batteries, made at the same factory that your original battery was made, but offered at a great price ($94.95).  I purchased one for my '04 Fatboy and she breathes fire like a new bike!!  Feel free to read my review on the ""ThrottleX Battery"" for Harley Davidson.As with all my reviews, the above is only my opinion or observation of an item that I own or have tested. Consider that it is possible that I may have either purchased/tested a faulty unit or an exceptionally good one. Your experience may differ from mine, better or worse.

You have to remove both taillights, run a wire through the cabin from taillight to taillight, and then a positive wire all the way up to the battery.  The latter was the most difficult.A set of ramps would certainly be helpful in running the battery wire up to the front.  It has to be weaved along the bottom of the vehicle and secured with zip strips along the way, avoiding obstacles that could degrade the wire or cause harm to something else.  The Windstar just sits too low to be able to do this without the ramps.I have no clue about how the lights work on my Windstar.  There is something with this model that a simple T-Connector won't work, so there is a bunch of other things attached to make it work.  I suppose the independent wire to the battery is to avoid shorting out the vehicle's electrical system if something went wrong with the trailer's.Hooked it up to my trailer lights and everything is working as it should.

(tip: if it's chilly out crank the heater up on high in your Jeep to help stretch the top so you do not tear a seam or zippers) I absolutely love the large windows as they are fairly larger then the ones on my old soft top and much larger then any other soft top I have seen. I would definitely recommend this top.What I like about it:-cost...under $400 for Rampage compared to $700 for the Bestop version-side and rear windows zip out to turn into a bikini/safari top-weighs only 18lbs and easily fits behind the rear seat if you want some sun-windows are huge (biggest I have seen on any top) and has almost zero blind spots-has a compartment to store windows while in bikini mode...Bestop tops do not offer this-map pockets above visors-uses roll bars for frame (good if you have/had a hard top)What I don't like about it:-top slaps the support bars between the windshield and roll/sound bar when going 40+ with door windows down (driving with your windows down is not good on a top though when your windows are zippered in...it will cause premature wear and tear on the stitching and seams)-the rear window does not fit in the window bag and you have to fold it to fit causing a somewhat lumpy top in safari modeKeep in mind you will need a windshield header channel for this top. If you have a soft top on your Jeep now you should have the door surrounds and tailgate bar.  If you have a hardtop you will need to buy door surrounds and a tailgate bar as well.If you have a hard top on your Jeep now then the Bestop version may be a better choice for you only because it comes with EVERYTHING you need to convert over to a soft top (windshield channel, door surrounds, and tailgate bar).I am definitely happy with this top though and will not hesitate to purchase another one if needed.",5.0,"04 13, 2013",Rampage 109535 Trail Top - Frameless/Bowless TJ,340.0,Rampage,2077,404,0.6666666666666666,5.141089108910891,6.677034900465909,1.1946105790109216,5.82975163357869,1.0

505,B0051E4AMY,"[16, 16]","Update 11/15/13: I had one of these coils go out on me after 1.5 years. My engine was stuttering like crazy with a check engine light and sure enough, it was coil #1 per a free Autozone code read.  I swapped it out with one of the spare coils I had on hand from when I originally replaced all of them at once and I'm back in business.  I am still very satisfied with this product.Original review: I had 2 different ignition coils go out on my Lincoln LS V8 over the period of a few months.  Each time I took it into my local shop to get it fixed, they charged me $116 for parts, not to mention labor, and the cost for one at my local auto parts supplier was around $70-$80 for each one.  I began looking for a less expensive alternative and found that this supplier sells 8 of them for less than the price of 1 purchased locally.When these first arrived I noticed the part number was different than the ones listed on my car.  After some searching online and contacting my local Ford dealer, I confirmed that these certainly do fit a Lincoln LS V8, mine happens to be a 2004.I would consider myself slightly above an amateur as I always change my own oil, rotate my tires, and have replaced the shocks and struts on 2 of my cars.  I do these things to save money, but I have to thoroughly research each of these projects and it sometimes takes me a while to do it.  Thankfully it is quite easy to change the ignition coils.  You just need a 7mm socket wrench and a small 7mm wrench to remove the bolts from the ignition coil covers on each side of the engine.  Some of these are in very tight spaces and take some very small movements, and some time, to remove and put back on.  There are 8 bolts on each side of the engine.  This is the hardest part, however.After removing the covers, all you need to do is unscrew each ignition coil, unplug them, swap them out, and then place the covers back on again. The total time for the project was around 30-45 minutes. I'll admit I was nervous about them working due to the unbelievable low price for 8 of them, but they have been working without any issues at all for a few months so far. Believe me, I know what my car drives like when my ignition coil is bad (stutters while accelerating around 50-65mph, stutters up hills).I even saved the 2 new coils my mechanic put in a few months ago as replacements if these ever start to go bad.  I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a DIY project to save potentially hundreds of dollars.  I technically could have waited for each coil to go, diagnose them one at a time at the auto shop, and then replace them one by one, but for this price, I figured why not just replace them all at once and not worry about it for hopefully several thousand miles.If I ever have issues with these coils, or if they start to fail earlier than expected, I will definitely update this review.",5.0,"03 19, 2012",#IC27 DG509 DG515 DG529 00-06 Lincoln Ls V8 3.9L Ignition Coil 8PCS 00 01 02 03 04 05 06,64.89,MotorKing,2879,560,1.0,5.1410714285714265,9.255295901635913,1.1946105790109216,1.112625245596827,0.05276542901992798

The old ones, a different brand, started a horrible squeaking noise whenever the lift on my 2002 Grand Cherokee was opened or closed.Changing these is fairly simple, although you will need a Torx bit (the 5-pointed star drives). Not sure of the size, but it was the biggest one in my kit. If you have never taken off the factory struts, the screws can be pretty tight, so you might need some sort of breaker bar and a little penetrating oil.While I am sure you coul dchange them yourself, having a helper to hold the gate makes things much easier. The rear hatch on a Jeep is heavier than you might expect, and it is just a bit tricky to line up the new struts. A little copper thread lube on the threads of the mounting studs will make removal much easier the next time.=== The Good Stuff ===* They fit fine.* The hatch opens and closes with a nice, smooth movement. It is about the same amount of ""springiness"" as the Jeep had when it was new (I think), although they are much springier than the 10 year-old units you might be replacing.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* None, really. These struts use clips which are a little different than the OEM, or even the last set that I installed. I doubt it makes any difference.=== Summary ===* These are one of those cheap and quick repairs that most anyone can perform on their car. They won't make it run any better, but they can keep a tailgate from hitting you on the head, always a nice feature on a car. To change these, you will need a flat screwdriver, a socket wrench (13mm if I remember correctly), and a large Torx driver with something to give you a bit of leverage.

579,B000BZGB9I,"[1, 1]","This is the second pump I've put in my Astro van.  I bought one of the cheap (60 dollar) ones about a year and a half ago.  It let go last week.  Since I'd actually cut an access hole in the floor, replacing the pump was simple.  undo the plate and I was looking at it.  The quality on this pump does seem to be higher.  The previous one &#34;sounded&#34; cheap, if that make sense, and it weighed less than this one.  As I say, time will tell, but this one does seem well built.Also, here are a couple of notes that may help you if you're doing this yourself.1-If you look at the top of this pump, you'll see two wiring connectors.  One flat, one square.  This is the original design.  At some point, and I'm not sure what year they did it, they changed the square connector to a flat connector similar to the other one.  It was done, from what I understand, because the original connector was prone to overheating/melting in some limited situations.  Mine's a '97, and it looks fine though-no sign of overheating.  MANY of these pumps include the new style connector and a replacement connector that you splice into your wiring harness.  If you're not comfortable doing this, figure out which one you have and make sure you order the correct pump.2-My Alldata subscription shows a lock ring holding this in.  There are four ears sticking up around the pump, so I tried prying and pounding on them.  They didn't move, so I got down and looked close, and these &#34;ears&#34; are part of the tank, they bump up to protect the connectors.  Look for a snap ring on top of the pump-the holes are between the two connectors.  Pop this out, and the pump will jump out in your hand-it's spring loaded into the tank.And a bonus...the new o-ring is a tight fit.  Be prepared for a struggle to get it in the tank properly.Finally, and I can't emphasize this enough, make sure that ANYTHING you're using to push or pry on this is non-sparking.

I have done this before on a previous tractor, also worked great.  Here are some tips, as I could not find any on the internet, making the first tire a bit time consuming.  Second one was a snap, once the installation process was nailed down.  There is no need to remove the wheel from the tractor.  Empty tire of air.  Break the outer bead by pushing the tire away from the rim.  This takes some muscle.  You do not need to pop the tire off from between the rims (by using tire tools or other device).  Rear seal of the tire (side towards the tractor) stays on.  Once the bead is broke, break off the stem and retrieve the portion that falls into the tire.  The inner tube is now ready for insertion.  This is important.  The blue stripe faces in towards the tractor.  Insert the tube by slipping into the tire and insert stem through hole in rim.  Pull stem and ensure the tire is evenly inserted.  Get some liquid soap and smother the wheel area that the outer bead will need to ride as the tube is inflated and the tire bead moves outward to create the seal.  It is useful at this point to have a second set of hands to keep the tire centered as air is inserted.  I used a compressor and one must keep in mind that the air between the tube and tire will be compressed if the tube is quickly filled.  To release this air, the stem is rocked back and forth.

667,B004B8IJ7I,"[1, 1]","I'm a fan of this brand as I own and enjoy their products like Perls and Cockpit Premium. For the price, they are great. I can't say the same for this spray. It works well when you do it the right way, however, the same results can be achieved using other products. If you like a convenient bottle, then this product is okay.In Texas and Florida, especially near the coasts, bugs are a major problem. For someone who obsesses over their car paint like me, I hate the idea of bugs baking in the sun onto my paint. Yet, I'm usually too tired to do a thorough hand wash after a long trip. Thus, I needed a dedicated bug cleaner.I sprayed this after 6 round-trips where my front bumper was coated with insects. 2 trips were in winter (40 F, no snow), 2 trips were in summer (100 F, high humidity), and one trip in the spring and fall (70-80 F). On average, it took 1/2 the bottle to clean the front of the car per trip. It performed poorly when sprayed according to the instructions on the bottle (3 minutes, then hose off). Instead, I sprayed and let it dwell for 5 minutes. Then, I took a very soft tile and grout sponge to gently scrub each panel horizontally and vertically. That did the trick. It took off every bug without marring the paint.However, using Optimum No Rinse Wash & Wax at a high dilution and soft sponge scrubbing did the same job as 1z + sponge. Also, an all purpose cleaner (any APC made by Optimum, 1z, Meguiars, etc.) safely diluted for paint, or a hot microfiber towel soaked in dish soap laid over the bumper will remove the bugs effectively too. However, these last two options are not as simple as ONR and a sponge.Optimum No Rinse (either the classic blue or newer green version) cost me $0.32/wash to clean a massive bug splatter. The same wash using 1z cost me $5/wash. With the ONR, I had to mess around with proper dilutions and pouring into an empty spray bottle. The 1z already came pre-diluted out of the box. If you have money and will pay 15x more for the convenience, get the 1z. Otherwise, use ONR or an alternate method.",3.0,"09 17, 2013",einszett 913912 Anti-Insekt Bug and Tar Remover - 16.9 fl. oz.,10.25,Einszett,2058,396,1.0,5.196969696969697,6.5448163875853975,0.7167663474065529,0.17574986542406346,1.0

FOREGET ABOUT 'EM !!!!! If your buying this to expect fuel savings, then choose a reasonable goal when selecting your MPG's during the set up.All this product does is monitor engine parameters and if you choose to use it, the Driving Coach. Now the driving coach will help, let me say it again.....The Driving coach will help you, you the driver to keep your damn foot out of it. Meaning accelerate slow keep a moderate speed etc to help you achieve the mpg your looking for. Really in a gas vehicle you don't really need it. You got everything you need to see in the dash anyway unless you just wanna spend money. This product DOES NOT TUNE YOUR VEHICLE it is a monitor only also let's you read and clear dtc codes and erase them. If you don't know what that is then its prolly useless to ya.Now for us Diesel guys and gals.The pyro kit is easy to install and if you choose to install more then one pyro then the second one will show up in the aux 1 of the watch dog or whatever slots you choose to put the wires in. If you have to drill a hole into the exhaust manifold this install will take about 30 minutes total start to finish. I don't use the driving coach at all I just use it to monitor egt, boost, coolant and trans temp. My diesel gets 19 mpg on the highway thanks to the SCT SF3 tuner. I find that the driving coach however will help to gain maybe 2 mpg extra mpg if you take it's advice. Can't beat it for the money. It is absolutely a dang good product.

The speed setting is located at the bottom near the cable. The on and off is conveniently located by the handle so you can use your thumb to actually turn it off. I was very grateful for this since I had to rest my arms and it made it easy to turn off while still holding it against the car.After awhile, the vibrations will make your arm feel like jelly. Lucky, I had a buddy and we switched off so our arms could rest. We used the DAP on the 3 setting and noticed that the machine got noticeably hotter after about 40 min of use. We were debating about letting it cool or trying to just finish since we were on the last section.  We finished with no problems.The noise level isn't too bad on 3. You may have to yell if you want to talk to people though.The next time I use it, I may put it on the 4 setting. On 3, I noticed the pad wasn't spinning that much but on 4, it spins at double the speed (noticed this at the end). I do worry about the device overheating on 4.

782,B000BQMKHO,"[2, 2]","I received my Wagan 2053 solar charger about two weeks ago from Amazon. I wanted a solar charger with replaceable batteries as opposed to the lithium ion versions where you are forced to toss the entire unit out in 2-3 years once the battery stops working. It seems to try and be green with solar power, but be throwing the units out after only few years.Also, modern NiMH batteries last for 2000 cycles so even if I used this charger once a day, I would not need to replace the batteries for 6 years. For comparison, the lithium ion chargers get about 1/4 as many cycles.How does it look/feel?The charger is solid, but nobody will mistake it for a premium product. It is also not a very pretty gadget.How does it work?it works OK. I tried three different phones and it only worked on one of them. It would not charge my Blackberry Curve or my Nokia N900 as both require some intelligent charging circuitry in the charger. This unit merely has a 5V charging socket without any intelligence. In contrast, the Solio models all charge these two phones fine.The charger came with a collection of tips for phones 5 that existed 5 years ago. Most phones use micro-USB these days and there is no included micro-USB tip.Another problem I had is that one cannot charge the device because it requires a specific 12V adapter which is not included.If you take it somewhere and deplete the batteries, there is no possibility to charge it up from a wall socket because the device requires a specific 12v adapter which is not included. Most similar products will charge from USB which makes it easy to charge them up on the go when it is not possible to charge via the solar panels.The only controls on the device are a three way switch that allow you to select 12V/Solar, Power From Batteries, and Charge Batteries. The ""12V/Solar"" option is a strange design choice as it is intended to be used when there are no batteries installed so that device can charge your phone directly from the solar panel instead of through the batteries.

Some mixed reviews were given to ALL of the restoration kits.  To address these concerns,  I took extra steps.  In the end, my headlights look brand new.The power ball and polish removed the yellow tint on my 2002 Honda Accord.  If your headlights have pits and other imperfections like mine did, You will need to use the sandpaper.Many of the other reviews I saw said to stay away from the sand paper that is included in the kit.  I agree.The kit includes two VERY SMALL double sided foam squares with 4 different grades of sand paper including 600, 1000, 1500, and 2000 gits. Not enough in my opinion.  So I bought a sheet of each grit at Ace for about $5.00Steps I took-Prep-  Clean headlamps, dry, use painters tape around headlamps to protect paint.Sanding-  wet sand  with each grit till plastic has uniform haze, change sanding directions for each grit.Power Buffed- with Turtle Wax rubbing compound with my orbital polisher, 2 applications.Power Ball- using Mother's Polish, 2 applications.Done.I took these extra steps after watching the YouTube Video list below.YouTube Title- How To Restore Headlight Clarity[...]In conclusion, Take a good look at your headlights before doing anything.  That way you can determine the appropriate steps.  The kit does what is says, it just needs more sandpaper.  The Mothers website has how to videos for this product on their website.  The first video for using just the polish is on the money.  The second video that covers the sanding does a good job of explaining proper technique, just make sure you spend the correct amount of time sanding.

Now for a little history:I purchased my first 4021B on on Amazon in '07, and it had worked flawlessly for the whole time until recently it went into a permanent ""L"" display mode, even after I changed the three LR44 button batteries. So I bought another 4021B from Amazon two weeks ago ... it works perfectly, and I verified it's accuracy.Playing around with both of them, I discovered a couple tiny differences: 1) the nozzle on the new one is BRASS (nice!), while the old one is plastic; 2) if you unscrew the small, cylindrical head, the air hole end is an inny now instead of an outy. I tried the old head on the new gauge, and it worked fine with it.I then took the old one apart completely just for fun to see if I could fix it. Here are the results: There is ANOTHER BATTERY inside this model! Who'd have believed it? It's a LARGE, 2032 button battery, and you must take out all NINE TINY SCREWS to get to it. You must be very careful to not break the extremely thin black and red wires from the LR44 batteries while you do this. I just replaced the 2032 battery, and the gauge CAME TO LIFE! Amazing! But moments later both wires broke, so now I must find a cheap, small soldering kit on Amazon. I'm not giving up!C'mon, all you folks with a permanent ""L"" on the display!

860,B000CGFVHO,"[1, 2]","I had the original pump in my 1998 Silverado Vortec 5.7. It was making a bad sound and I was sure that it was getting ready to ""GoOut"". Decided to replace it with a Delphi Unit. Plans do go bad.... After pulling the bed and replacing the pump, I thought that this was surely a plug and play deal. Wrong!!! I didn't bother to check anything other than my installation ie; wiring etc.. That was my first mistake. I opted to solder and heat shrink the new wiring harness, inspect the connections for proper wiring etc. Put it all back together and truck ran worse than it did beforeI changed it out. What to do, What to do...At this point I had about 4 hrs into this garage project. Now I had to delve into trouble shooting. I checked the obvious, power/grounds etc. Everything looked good. The best thing I ever did was to order a fuel pump pressure gauge (from amazon of course) and check the pressure on the output of the pump. I knew I had found my problem. It read only 38lbs, and it should have been 60-66 lbs. That was on the fuel rail. I further tested the electrical connection at the connector Gray/Black, it had 12.5 volts coming from the battery. When the pump was running for the 2sec with the keyon/keyoff test the voltage reading was 11.6v showing that the pump seemed to have the proper voltage drop.. I further tested the pump by rigging up a ""Tee"" in place of the fuel filter and connecting my pressure testgauge. The ""Dead Head"" test showed the same reading as the fuel rail, 38 lbs.Bingo, Bad Pump!!! Voltage checks out, Pump is low pressure. Electrically the pump was probably fine, I'm not sure how the thing totally works but it is probably a diaphragm leaking or stuck I would guess. The good news is that I have It fixed. My new fuel pump came from Amazon yesterday, and I installed it today. Works like a champ, even though I opted for a Carter/Federal Mogel #P74757M. It was cheaper and it works, 62PSI like it should be. Even though Amazon's website flags this model as not being correct for this make vehicle. You should always double check/crosscheck with another vendor for proper part listing. I always double check with RockAuto.com because they are always correct on the part #'s. I always go with Amazon if they arecheaper than Rockauto with the combined shipping. Most of the time Amazon has the better price with the shipping, so it pays to compare. Always double check the part number with amazon, you will find that they are wrong once in awhile, and if the part that you are looking for doesn't come up for your make/model just type it in directlyand it may be there if they stock it... That's how I found my Carter P74757M for $161.00. It is the exact fuel pump that they sell at Napa for over $300.00.Just because you are buying a new fuel pump don't take it for granted that it will work out of the box Take the time to look at the voltage drops and fix the problem if there is one. Buy a cheap fuel pressure gauge and verify output is in Spec!!! Good Luck.. That will surely save you from doing the job twice like I had to do.By the way, I had absolutely no trouble in returning the defective pump to Amazon.I reported it to Customer service and they gave me the option of replacing it with the same pump or a full refund. That also included a free mailing label sent to my printer for the return shipping.

That truck set for about 7 years before I bought it (wonder why....8 MPG ??!!), so it is still loosening up. BUT, I can tell when the Lucas additive is in, and when it is not.Everyone will have to decide if their savings is worth the cost of the additive. 10 % improvement is like getting 35 cents a gallon off the current cost. With the GMC, it might be 20% or better. Anything beyond 10% is money in the bank. The smoothness counts for something also. The smoother an engine is, the smoother the transmission shifts.....so, money saved in the long run. Our rural stations all have a pump with non-ethanol gas....about 25 cents a gallon more.

926,B000C5WCUE,"[2, 2]","My car is a 2000 Lexus ES300. The check engine light came on and the OBDII diagnostic codes were 1150 & 1155. Toyota wanted $206.00 for the replacement Denso oxygen sensor (Air-Fuel sensor) to correct it. Ouch! I searched Amazon for a better price and WOW! They listed a 'universal' replacement for the exact same OEM part number! Hmmm... OEM for $206? ...or a universal for just $30?  Well, DUH?! ...I went with the $30.00 universal 02 sensor. That turned out to be the very best option because these sensors often fail in pairs. BTW: This universal sensor is a Denso too, and its identical to the original but there is just no part# stamped on it!My 2000 Lexus 300 responded fine to the first (front side) sensor, then about four days later the light came on again. This time the only code was 1155, which is a code for the other (rear) O2 sensor on the other side of the engine. I checked the Lexus forums and found that this is very common if you ever put cheap fuel injector cleaner in your gas tank. Shazzam, I had done that just about 2000 miles before the check engine light had come on! Turns out some of the chemicals in the cheaper fuel injector cleaners attacks the special heat resistant coating on O2 sensors. I immediately ordered universal sensor number two. It also arrived within 5 days. Anyway, its all good now and I'll never use those fuel additives again.Installation is super simple for the front exhaust manifold O2 sensor but you'll need a special 7/8"" O2 sensor socket to remove the one on the back exhaust manifold. (Amazon, $10) Its in a tight little area so a big 7/8"" open-end wrench just can't reach it.Note that you'll re-use the original wiring and plugs on the new universal sensors. Its easy; just read the wiring guide to splice the new wires to your original plug harnesses. There are just four wires and my wire colors were identical to the OEM harnesses. You'll use the simple splices provided in the universal sensor package. It only takes about 10-15 minutes to splice in the new wires to the original connector plugs.After about 650 miles now I'm enjoying an unexpected benefit. Since new, this car never ever ran as good as it does now. I noticed right away that it is far more zippy. The mileage in town is about 4 mpg better too. That means I'll pay for the two sensors in a year.",5.0,"10 2, 2011",Denso 234-4209 Oxygen Sensor,36.78,Denso,2325,440,1.0,5.284090909090909,7.272018208428219,1.1946105790109216,0.6306419561265418,1.0

'Side lobes' angle out around 45degress each side of the lights and are very nice at illuminating road markers and the crazy wildlife.One Pencil and one Euro Beam is a nice combo.

947,B003A9HGIM,"[37, 38]","I purchased the full kit, which includes two NiCd batteries, a charger, and carry bag.  Only had it for a week or so, so can't comment on longevity or battery life.  What i can conclude though is this thing delivers the torque.  This impact is rated to 200 ft-lb.  I got access to a 250 ft-lb torque wrench and confirmed that this will in fact loosen bolts tightened to 200 ft-lb, barely.  Might eek out a bit more, but 200 is already pushing the limit.  I'm glad to see a tool deliver its rated specs.  I tried it out on my car, which just got back from the tire shop.  They always crank the hell out of the lug nuts with their air tools and this Craftsman had no trouble getting the lug nuts off.  Did some brake bleeding over the weekend, so all four wheels came off and on no problem.  I have yet to run this thing down, but doing 16 lugs off and then back on was a non-issue.The handle is covered in rubber.  The red part of the trigger is plastic, with a black rubber inlay.  Overall, the tool feels good in the hand.  I'm quite impressed with it, especially considering the price.  I was originally going to spend $300+ on one of the more powerful cordless impacts out there, but i'm glad i held off.  If you're not working on heavy equipment all day, this impact seems to do the job for your average auto repair duties.  I'll update this review as I get more time with this tool.  Sure, i just did my wife's brakes, but that was pre-impact.  My car now needs brakes and I can't wait to let the impact loose again.  How the heck did i live without this thing for so many years....December 2011 Update (1 year ownership)So I haven't exactly been using this every weekend, but it never fails to impress.  I've done brakes, tire rotations, and a CV axle replacement with this tool's help.  I end up way less tired at the end of the day.  It's tough enough working near the ground, in the driveway for several hours.  With this tool, I get my work done faster and end up a much happier guy at the end of the job.  I primarily use the tool for a lithium battery which holds a charge well for the occasional use the impact sees.",5.0,"11 23, 2010",Craftsman 19.2v C3 1/2&quot; Impact Wrench (Tool Only.

With Johnsen's 12 pack here - the price per unit drops to $4.27/can, which is almost unheard of! I have used this product before and it did a great job! I lived in the southeastern coast of NC, which delivered some of the most brutally hot/humid conditions imaginable. It's important to mention, I have a leak in my A/C system that cannot be detected. This requires my A/C be recharged periodically (maybe once a month in the summer).This product package is a superior value! In the stores (Wal-Mart, for example) you are almost certain to pay at least $9.99/can. If you take your car to a mechanic and have the A/C recharged, you will probably pay at least $69.00 to $99.00, having virtually the same results.You need to have an A/C dispenser that screws into the top of these cans. That should be a one-time-only purchase only. You can buy one here on Amazon. Like any A/C system, you need to drive your car around for awhile in the heat before the interior cabin temperature of your vehicle drops significantly. If no results are achieved, it is safe to say a larger A/C problem is to blame. All parts need to be working together in order for the refrigerant to do its job.
